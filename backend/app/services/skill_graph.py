"""
Skill graph service for compatibility scoring v2.

Provides alias normalization, family lookup, and intra-family transferability
scores from a curated JSON graph at backend/app/data/skill_graph.json.

The graph captures the insight that frameworks within the same family share
underlying paradigms (e.g. React/Vue/Angular are all component-based reactive
UI frameworks), so a candidate skilled in one is typically productive in
another within days or weeks.
